### Future Growth Prospects ###
Sanjay will take you all through the industry view, our business performance and also give a strategic outlook for the future growth of the company at the end.
After the successful acquisition of Exotech and the robust performance we delivered there in the last two years, we have gained more confidence in our execution capabilities of acquiring and integrating companies that could take SJS to the next level of growth.
With Walter Pack acquisition, we have not only acquired a very large growth and high margin business at a good valuation, but at the same time achieved many key strategic objectives in terms of addition of new and emerging technologies, new customers, manufacturing capabilities and increase management bandwidth.
I am excited and eagerly looking forward to see how SJS grows multi-folds in the future with all the synergies and cross-selling opportunities playing out amongst the three companies.
Walter Pack Q1 witnessed a strong revenue growth of 21% YoY and a robust margin performance with EBITDA margins around 31.5%.

### Triggers for Earnings ###
As a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen-only mode and there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes.
Ronak Mehta: So continuing on WPI, wanted to check so what are the opportunity areas for cross selling from the existing business?
K.A. Joseph: One is we have a cross selling opportunity between two companies.
So this just adds some additional opportunity for Walter Pack technology to be used for these customers.
Vishal Khurana: How big can this TV opportunity be since we are manufacturing a lot of television and other electronic items in India now?


### Material Information Affecting Growth ###
However, I would like to inform you that we are seeing improvement in the export markets and our export revenue almost doubled for the quarter compared to last year same quarter which was impacted due to geopolitical issues in Europe and also macroeconomic slowdown in North America.
Q1 FY24 export constitute 11% of consolidated sales compared to 6% of the sales last year, that was impacted due to external geopolitical and macroeconomic factors.
This has impact of 30 bps on a YoY basis and that was due to one-off expenses under other expenses to the tune of Rs.8 million for interest on GST.
We are revising the expansion plans to align more effectively with the evolving business requirements of both Walter Pack and Exotech.
Devanshi Dhruva: Basically, we would just want to be more effective and be very frugal with our investment.
